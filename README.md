🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (2021–2022)
This Power BI project analyzes road accident data from the years 2021 and 2022 to identify key patterns, trends, and factors contributing to accidents. The dashboard helps stakeholders make informed decisions by providing insightful KPIs and visualizations.

📌 Objective
-To build a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard that enables clients to:
-Understand accident trends across years
-Analyze accident severity, types, and affected areas
-Compare year-over-year (YoY) changes
-Make data-driven decisions for road safety improvements

🧾 Requirements Addressed
✅ Primary KPIs:
Total Casualties and Total Accidents (Current Year + YoY Growth)
Total Casualties by Accident Severity (Current Year + YoY Growth)

✅ Secondary KPIs:
Casualties by Vehicle Type (Current Year)
Monthly Trend of Casualties (Current vs. Previous Year)
Casualties by Road Type (Current Year)
Casualties by Area/Location (Urban, Rural) and Time (Day/Night)
Total Casualties and Accidents by Location
